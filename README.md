# multiplayer-dos-tetris
A multiplayer version of Tetris for DOS with network multiplayer support via filesharing.

SYNTAX: TETRIS <network-path> <your name (max. 8 chars)>
    or: TETRIS -1   (for a single player game)

This is a network version of the classic arcade game, TETRIS.
The rules are simple: Complete as many lines as possible. As soon as you clear one or more lines, they'll disappear. Your Opponent will receive as many additional lines as you complete!!

What's needed to play? First, you must have read/write access to a shared network directory (a directory on the server). Every player needs R/W-access to this specific directory. Let's assume that your company's poject-directory is "U:\PROJECTS" and everyone has access to it. Now you need a name (...) Let`s take "Lucy" for example. Now start the game with "TETRIS U:\PROJECTS Lucy". Voila! Your game-mates should do the same (except for the name, of course)
Select your opponent from the userlist and get into it!

If you want to play alone (no network) then just execute "TETRIS -1"
